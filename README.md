DESCRIPTION

During the break between semesters, you have decided to enroll in a special course. The course has n assignments, which you can attempt in any order. The ith assignment is worth mi marks, but it will take ti hours to complete it fully. If you try to do more than T hours work (in total), you will become too tired and will have no choice but to take a holiday instead of completing the course. Fortunately, the amount of credit you will get for each assignment is directly proportional to the amount of work you put into it.
For each assignment i you must decide how much progress pi to make. You will get pimi marks, but it will have taken piti hours of work. Your goal is to maximise your total marks, without exceeding T hours work in total.
